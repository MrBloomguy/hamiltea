# YouBuidl Platform Positioning

## 🎯 What is YouBuidl?

**YouBuidl** is the flagship **creator economy streaming platform** on EVM networks. It enables creators to launch their own coins and stream daily earnings in real-time to their communities.

---

## 🌊 Flagship Feature: Streaming

The **core value proposition** of YouBuidl is **streaming**.

### How It Works:
1. **Creator/Builder** launches their own token (e.g., `$ALICE`, `$BOB`)
2. **Creator streams daily earnings** to all coin holders using Superfluid protocol
3. **Coin holders receive real-time earnings** - every second, not just daily
4. **Automated and trustless** - no manual distributions needed

### Example:
- Alice launches `$ALICE` token on Base
- Alice earns $1,000/day from her activities (content creation, teaching, etc.)
- She sets up a stream to send 50% of earnings ($500/day) to all `$ALICE` holders
- Each holder receives their proportional share **every second** (~$500 / 86,400 seconds per holder)
- If 100 people hold `$ALICE` equally, each gets ~$0.058 per second = ~$5,000/year per person!

### Why Streaming?
- **Real-time** - No waiting for payouts
- **Transparent** - Amount flows continuously on-chain
- **Automated** - Set once, runs forever
- **Creator-Friendly** - Builds loyalty and engagement
- **DeFi-Native** - Leverages Superfluid's proven infrastructure

## 📊 Supporting Feature: Portfolio Tracker

The **portfolio tracker** (Axiom-inspired tool) helps **traders/community members** monitor their creator coin investments.

### What It Does:
- Track multiple creator coins you own across your wallets
- See real-time P&L on your creator coin investments
- View transaction history and entry prices
- Identify which creator coins you're winning on
- Monitor portfolio diversity and risk

### Why It Matters:
- **For Traders:** Understand their creator coin portfolio performance
- **For Creators:** See who's invested in their coin and how much
- **For the Ecosystem:** Transparency and trust
